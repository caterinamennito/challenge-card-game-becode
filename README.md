## ðŸ“‹ Description
This project simulates the basic mechanics of a card game using OOP principles in Python. The game generates a standard 52-card deck, distributes the cards evenly among players, and lets each player play a card per turn until all cards are played. The focus is on clean architecture, class inheritance, and proper code structure.
